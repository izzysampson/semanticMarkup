            <h2>What is the hype all about?</h2>
            <p>Brazil has many things that lead to the overall hype. This web page will walk you through a few of the
                greatest things about Brazil and will also introduce you to my personal experience with this beautiful
                country.</p>
            <p>Think about this: Have you ever seen the movie <em>Rio from Disney?</em> Why is it so good? I would say
                it's a great movie because it introduces you to the great culture.</p>

            <h3>What should I do if I go to Brazil?</h3>
            <h5>Brazil is FULL of incredible places to visit. The following places are the only locations I've been to
                so they're really the only one's I can suggest. Most of these places are in the south-eastern corner of
                the country.</h5>
                <p>Here are good states to visit and my personal definition of them:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>State of São Paulo</dt>
                    <dd>In the state of São Paulo, this is where you find the country's capital. It's a very
                        well-developed city that provides many opportunites for great shopping and city-life activities.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>State of Minas Gerais</dt>
                    <dd>Minas is the home of the best Brazilian food, pão de quejo (aka cheesy bread). Go to Minas just
                        for the food though because there isn't a lot to do there other than eat.</dd>
                    <dt>State of Rio de Janeiro</dt>
                    <dd>Rio is the state you go to if you wanna party (it's a little worldy there). But it's absolutley
                        <strong>beautiful</strong> and is one of the best ways to experience the culture.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

    <!--Aside Info - Why I like Brazil-->
    <aside>
        <h2>Why do I like Brazil?</h2>
        <p>One of the main reasons I personally like Brazil is because I lived there for 10 months and fell in love with
            the culture. Here are a few specific reasons: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The people are fun</li>
            <li>The weather is good</li>
            <li>You make really good memories there. Some of my favorite memories are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Picking food from the trees on the street (snacks to go)</li>
                <li>Sporatic dance parties whenever music comes on</li>
                <li>Becoming a part of a social unit, one that is super accepting</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>One downfall is that you may get cat-called walking on the street if you're an American.</p>
